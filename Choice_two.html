    <h1>The History of CSS</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>What is CSS</h2>
    <h4>CSS is one of three cornerstone technologies used on the web (the other two are HTML and JavaScript). CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets – the clues are really in the words ‘cascading’ and ‘style’ with cascading describing the way that one style can cascade from one to another. One of the many benefits of CSS is that more than one style can be used within one HTML document. </h4>
    <h4>CSS is used as a way of defining how HTML code is going to look on a website. Whereas HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create content, including written text, CSS alters the way a web page will look.</h4>
    <h2><strong>What is CSS used for?</strong></h2>
    <h4> CSS ensures that your web pages are consistent. Imagine a website with 100s of pages, now imagine having to input the code to define heading sizes, layout and other display data and mix that all in with the content each time you wanted to produce a new page. Also, imagine having a site with 100s of pages and being able to change just one of them while keeping all the rest the same – CSS also makes that a possibility. Using CSS delivers consistency where it is needed but is flexible enough to enable you to make changes to individual pages or sections. </h4>
